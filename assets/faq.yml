  content: "<h2><li>What's the purpose of this website?</li></h2> <br />The purpose of this website is to list Windows software that runs natively on ARM architecture without any emulation, in one place. Instead of searching on the internet for the specific arm software support, or digging through the software's website/documentation, it's easier to find the software here with a download link. This website idea came to my head after thinking about the hassle of scouring the internet just to find programs for my needs that has ARM builds. <br /> <h2><li>Can I also add new software to this website?</li></h2> <br />Yes, you can. Maintaining this little 'project' is not easy for one person, so if you have found a Windows native ARM software, or noticed an error/addition, please contribute on github by creating a pull request.<br /> <h2><li>Can I run non native x86 software on Windows ARM?</li></h2> <br />Of course. No one is preventing you from installing 32/64 bit Windows software. It will work, but emulation is not as fast as running the software natively. Sidenote: Windows 11 supports x64 software emulation, when Windows 10 builds can only emulate x86 software, meaning that x64 architecture software won't run on Windows 10. If you're using a Windows 11 build, that doesn't necessarily mean x64 emulation will work, as it's also dependent on your processor.<br />"
